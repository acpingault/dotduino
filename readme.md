## Dotduino

This is a library of files that I have made in my time working with the Adafruit Trinket M0, a microcontroller that can run either CircuitPython or Arduino (C++) code. 

This is a working directory, so it should be assumed that the code will be updated at random times. Most updates will take place on Saturdays or Sundays (at the end of the week).

Detailed below is a list of all directories and a short summary of what functions and files lie inside them. 

- Acceldot
  - A file that corresponds the Trinket's DotStar onboard LED color to the G force experienced in the Z-axis. This uses an Adafruit LIS3DH accelerometer to get accel data in the X,Y, and Z axies.
